# zip_code

This program uses a free API at http://ziptasticapi.com/ to check a list of zip codes to see if they are valid US zip codes
and output the results as a spreadsheet using the xlsx package. 
Currently a array of zip codes must be hard coded into the program. Future enhancements might include a user interface to 
select a csv file and create the array automatically.
